  teaser: |
    Configure your code editor with the Terraform extension and open a workspace.
  assignment: |-
    Open the Code Editor tab on the left. First get familiar with the menus. This is running the Visual Studio Code editor. You can also use the simpler "Text Editor" tab if you prefer.

    If you do use the VS Code Editor, please perform the following steps:

    Notice the menu bar with File, Edit, and other menus at the top of the VS Code Editor. You can find all the menus on this menu bar.

    You should see some files in the explorer bar on the left side menu. These are terraform config files for the hashicat application. Open file called "main.tf.

    Next you should install the Terraform extension to enable syntax highlighting in your code. Click on the extensions icon - it looks like four small boxes with one slightly out of position.

    Search for **Terraform** and be sure to select the "HashiCorp Terraform 2.x.y" extension. **Do not select the "Terraform 1.4.0" extension from mauve.** Click the green **Install** button to install the extension. Then click the **Reload Required** button to activate it. Then click the icon with two pages under the File menu so you can see your Terraform files again.

    We have enabled auto-save in your Code Editor, so any changes you make will be saved as you type. You don't have to worry about saving files manually.

    We recommend executing all commands on the "Shell" tab. But you can also open and use a terminal window at the bottom of the Visual Code Editor by using the Terminal > New Terminal menu or the **<ctrl>-`** shortcut.

    If you do use the VS Code terminal, you can toggle its size up and down with the `^` and inverted `^` buttons above it. You can get rid of it with the garbage can and `x` icons.

    Congratulations, you are ready to start working with Terraform.

    Click the **Check** button to continue.

  title: ☁️ Terraform Cloud Setup
  teaser: |
    Terraform Cloud offers almost all the same features as on-premise Terraform Enterprise.
  assignment: |-
    During this challenge you'll sign up for a free Terraform Cloud account. Click on the URL below and sign up for an account if you don't have one already:

    https://app.terraform.io/signup/account

    If you already have an account you can simply sign in with your existing credentials.

    Next you'll configure a token for running terraform commands from your workstation.

    Let's generate a new **user token** for use on your workstation. Visit the User Settings > Tokens page in Terraform Cloud:

    https://app.terraform.io/app/settings/tokens

    Click on the **Create an API token** button. You can name the token whatever you like. Copy the entire token using your mouse or the small copy-paste icon.

    Back in the Instruqt track, you need to add your API token to a file called "credentials.tfrc.json". You can do this in two different ways:

    The easier way is to select the "Credentials File" tab and open the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file directly.

    But if you prefer to use the VS Code Editor, you can use the File > Open menu, click on "..", select ".terraform.d", and then select the "credentials.tfrc.json" file.

    In either case, replace the part that says YOURTOKEN with what you copied from Terraform Cloud. If you use the "Credentials File" tab,  sure to save the file.

    Your token is now safely stored in the `/root/.terraform.d/credentials.tfrc.json` file.

    We'll be using this token for some of the lab exercises later in the track.

    Also edit the remote_backend.tf file in your workspace directory, replacing `YOURORGANIZATION` with the name of your Terraform Cloud organization and `YOURWORKSPACE` with `tfc-module-lab`.

    Terraform modules can be stored in your Version Control System.
  assignment: |-
    In order for different teams and individuals to be able to work on the same Terraform code, you need to use a Version Control System (VCS). Terraform Cloud can integrate with the most popular VCS systems including GitHub, GitLab and Bitbucket.

    You will need a free GitHub.com account for this challenge. We recommend using a personal account for training instead your work account (if you have one).

    Follow the **Configuring GitHub Access** section of the TFC documentation to connect your GitHub account to your Terraform Organization.

    https://www.terraform.io/docs/cloud/vcs/github.html

    Once you've configured GitHub access, you can import modules into your private module registry.

  title: "\U0001F4DA Private Module Registry"
  teaser: |
    Some of your users want a simple way to deploy databases and network configurations. Enter the Private Module Registry, where you can store standard, re-usable Terraform configurations that others can use in their own workspaces.
  assignment: |-
    In this challenge you'll learn to use the Private Module Registry, which allows you to store and version re-usable snippets of Terraform code. Think of modules like custom resources for your own environment.

    Instead of writing this module from scratch you can copy the existing vpc module from the public Terraform registry. Visit this URL to view the VPC module:

    https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-aws-modules/vpc/aws

    Note the **Source:** link that points at the github repository for this module. Click on the Source URL. As you did in previous workshop tracks, create your own fork of this repository with the **Fork** button.

    Back in the Terraform Cloud control panel, click on the **Modules** link at the top of the page. Click on the **+Add Module** button. Click on the Github button and select the terraform-aws-vpc module that you just forked.

    Click on **Publish Module**.

    Create a new Terraform file called `main.tf` in your "workspace" directory and add a module to your module in it to create a new VPC. You'll also want to add an `aws` provider block and set its `region` attribute to `eu-west-1` to match the availability zones in the sample code.

    HINT: The docs are your friend. They might even have an example of how the code should look. But be sure to set the source of the module to the one shown for it in your Private Module Registry. Don't use the source from the module's README.md file.

    After you finish editing your main.tf file, you can initialize your Terraform configuration with this command:

    ```
    terraform init
    ```

    You can find your AWS keys with these commands:
    ```
    echo $AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    echo $AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    ```

    Add your AWS keys to your new workspace, "tfc-module-lab", as environment variables on the workspace's Variables tab. Be sure to mark your `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable as sensitive.

    Now, do an apply against your workspace with this command:
    ```
    terraform apply
    ```

    Type "yes" if you are prompted to confirm the apply.

    If all goes well you should see a new VPC being built in the streaming apply log. Wait until your terraform apply command is complete, then click the `Check` button to verify your work.

    Please destroy the VPC you created with this command:

    ```
    terraform destroy
    ```

    Type "yes" when asked to confirm the destroy plan.

    Congratulations on completing the Terraform Module Lab!
